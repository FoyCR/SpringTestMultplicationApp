# Multplication App

This is the first time using the Java Spring Framework. I using the book "Learn Microservices with Spring Boot 3: A Practical Approach Using Event-Driven Architecture, Cloud-Native Patterns, and Containerization, Third Edition" as guide.

The idea is the web application to "build will encourage users to exercise their brains daily.
To begin with, it will present users with two-digit multiplications, one every time they
access the page. They will type their alias (a short name) and their guess for the result of
the operation. The idea is that they should use only mental calculations. After they send
the data, the web page will indicate if the guess was correct or not."
